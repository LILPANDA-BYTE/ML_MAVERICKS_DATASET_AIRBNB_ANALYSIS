* **Data Quality:** The `rating` column contains `"New"` for unrated listings, requiring preprocessing. The `Unnamed: 0` column is likely redundant.
* **Geographical Scope:** Listings are primarily from Turkey and Georgia, suggesting a regional focus.
* **Target Variable:** Likely `price` for regression or a categorical variable (e.g., rating bins) for classification.

### 4. Model Evaluation

```python
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay

def evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred, model_name):
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
    precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
    recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
    f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')

    print(f"\n{model_name} Performance:")
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
    print(f"Precision: {precision:.4f}")
    print(f"Recall: {recall:.4f}")
    print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")

    cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
    print(f"\nConfusion Matrix ({model_name}):\n{cm}")

    disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=np.unique(y_true))
    disp.plot(cmap=plt.cm.Blues, colorbar=True)
    plt.title(f"Confusion Matrix - {model_name}")
    plt.show()

# Evaluate Logistic Regression
evaluate_model(y_val_meta, meta_pred_lr, "Meta-Model (Logistic Regression)")

# Evaluate XGBoost
evaluate_model(y_val_meta, meta_pred_xgb, "Meta-Model (XGBoost)")
```

**Observations:**

* The evaluation focuses on meta-models in a stacking ensemble, combining predictions from base models.
* Metrics suggest a multi-class classification task (e.g., predicting rating categories or price bins).
* Confusion matrices provide visual insights into model performance across classes.

## Feature Engineering Techniques

While the provided snippet does not include explicit feature engineering code, the imported libraries and dataset structure suggest the following techniques:

1. **Handling Non-Numeric Values**:

   * Convert rating values marked as `"New"` to a numeric placeholder (e.g., `0`) or impute using mean/median ratings.
   * Handle potential missing values in other columns (e.g., amenities, address) via imputation or exclusion.

2. **Categorical Encoding**:

   * Use `LabelBinarizer` for binary categorical variables like `country` (e.g., Turkey vs. Georgia).
   * Apply one-hot encoding or target encoding for `checkin`, `checkout`, or parsed `amenities`.

3. **Text Processing**:

   * Parse `amenities` and `features` into binary features (e.g., `has_wifi`, `has_kitchen`) or use TF-IDF for text-based features like `name` or `address`.
   * Extract location-based features from `address` (e.g., city, region).

4. **Numerical Scaling**:

   * Apply `StandardScaler` to normalize numerical features like `price`, `beds`, `bathrooms`, and `guests` to ensure model compatibility.

5. **Feature Extraction**:

   * Derive features from `features` column (e.g., guest-to-bedroom ratio) if not already separated.
   * Create binary indicators for check-in flexibility (e.g., `checkin == "Flexible"`).

6. **High-Cardinality Handling**:

   * Cluster high-cardinality features like `host_name` or `amenities` using K-Means or reduce categories via grouping.

## Models Used

The notebook evaluates two meta-models as part of a stacking ensemble approach:

* **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used as a baseline for combining predictions from base models. Suitable for classification tasks with linear decision boundaries.
* **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting model for capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Likely used to improve performance over the baseline.

**Implied Base Models**:

* `BaggingClassifier`: Reduces variance by training on data subsets.
* `RandomForestClassifier`: Uses multiple decision trees to mitigate overfitting.
* `AdaBoostClassifier`: Combines weak learners via boosting.
* `GradientBoostingClassifier`: Sequentially corrects errors from previous models.
* `VotingClassifier`: Aggregates predictions from multiple models for robustness.

**Model Selection**:

* `GridSearchCV` and `KFold` indicate hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance.

---

## Results

Although specific numerical results are not provided in the snippet, the `evaluate_model` function computes the following metrics for both meta-models:

* **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
* **Precision**: Weighted average of positive prediction accuracy across classes.
* **Recall**: Weighted average of true positive rates across classes.
* **F1 Score**: Weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall.
* **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes classification performance across classes.

**Hypothetical Outcomes**:

* **Logistic Regression**: Expected to achieve moderate performance (e.g., accuracy of 0.70–0.80) due to its simplicity.
* **XGBoost**: Likely outperforms Logistic Regression (e.g., accuracy of 0.85–0.90) due to its ability to model complex patterns.

Key Insights: Confusion matrices reveal misclassification patterns, helping identify classes (e.g., rating categories) where models struggle.
Feature Importance: XGBoost’s feature importance analysis likely highlights influential features like `price`, `amenities`, or `beds`.

## Key Findings

* **Data Quality**:

  * The `rating` column’s `"New"` values require preprocessing to enable numerical analysis.
  * The `Unnamed: 0` column is redundant and should be dropped.
  * Missing values (if any) in `amenities` or other columns need handling.

* **Feature Diversity**:

  * Numerical features (`price`, `beds`, `guests`) and categorical features (`country`, `checkin`) provide a rich basis for analysis.
  * Text-based features (`amenities`, `address`) offer opportunities for advanced feature extraction.

* **Model Readiness**:

  * The notebook is well-equipped for a stacking ensemble approach, with robust evaluation metrics.
  * Additional preprocessing and base model training steps are needed to complete the pipeline.

## Potential Visualizations

1. **Price Distribution**:

```python
sns.histplot(df['price'], bins=20, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Listing Prices')
plt.xlabel('Price')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

2. **Rating vs. Price**:

```python
df['rating_numeric'] = pd.to_numeric(df['rating'], errors='coerce')
sns.scatterplot(
    x='rating_numeric', y='price', hue='country', data=df
)
plt.title('Rating vs. Price by Country')
plt.xlabel('Rating')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.show()
```

3. **Amenities Count**:

```python
df['amenities_count'] = df['amenities'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split(',')))
sns.boxplot(x='country', y='amenities_count', data=df)
plt.title('Number of Amenities by Country')
plt.show()
```

## Future Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**:

   * Remove the `Unnamed: 0` column.
   * Convert rating values marked `"New"` to a numeric placeholder or impute based on similar listings.
   * Check for and handle missing values in other columns.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:

   * Analyze correlations between `price` and features like `beds`, `guests`, or `amenities_count`.
   * Group amenities into categories (e.g., essentials, luxury) for deeper insights.

3. **Machine Learning Pipeline**:

   * Implement preprocessing steps (e.g., encoding, scaling) using a Pipeline for reproducibility.
   * Train and evaluate base models (`RandomForestClassifier`, `GradientBoostingClassifier`) before feeding predictions to meta-models.
   * Experiment with regression tasks for price prediction alongside classification.

4. **Reporting & Visualization**:

   * Save plots to a `figures/` directory for documentation.
   * Generate detailed classification reports and feature importance plots.

5. **Packaging**:

   * Modularize the code into scripts (e.g., `preprocessing.py`, `modeling.py`).
   * Create a Python package for reusability, as no packages are currently published in the repository.
